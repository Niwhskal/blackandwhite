Hello there. 

I'm Lakshwin. 

### What do I do ?

I'm an independent researcher. 

I spend most of my time studying Cognition and Intelligence; anchored to these two areas, I explore their influences in:  Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Philosophy, Psychology, Machine learning, Neuroscience, and their combinatorial domains. 

I was previously a research intern at Rakuten Institute of Technology (RIT) (2019) and ABB Research Lab (2018).

### Research interests

I have a fascination with *intelligence*[^1] that runs quite close to obsession. This trait has grounded my scientific interest to the fields of Cognitive science and Machine learning. Particularly, I am seeking to understand the mental processes that enable biological organisms to adapt and generalize wildly. I wish to understand where intelligence originates from, what gives rise to it, the degrees it can manifest to, and it's relationship with cognition. My overarching research goal is to formalize an explanatory theory of "intelligence" that remains within the confines of mathematics, physics and psychology. 

[^1]: "The ability of a biological organism to adapt and generalize to any situation"

This website serves as a platform for me to share my fascination with you. While at it, I may occasionally try to flaunt my art. I hope you will take it in good spirit.
